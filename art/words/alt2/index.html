        Am I then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought forth into this world? 
        Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is pleasing.' 
        And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou mightest enjoy pleasure? 
        Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mightest always be busy and in action? 
        Seest thou not how all things in the world besides, how every tree md plant, how sparrows and ants, 
        spiders and bees: how all in their kind are intent as it were orderly to perform whatsoever 
        (towards the preservation of this orderly universe) naturally doth become and belong unto thin? 
        And wilt not thou do that, which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy nature doth require? 'But thou must have some rest.' 
        Yes, thou must. 
        Nature hath of that also, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed thee a certain stint. 
        But thou guest beyond thy stint, and beyond that which would suffice, and in matter of action, there thou comest short of that which thou mayest. 
        It must needs be therefore, that thou dost not love thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst also love thy nature, and that which thy nature doth propose unto herself as her end. 
        Others, as many as take pleasure in their trade and profession, can even pine themselves at their works, and neglect their bodies and their food for it; and doest thou less honour thy nature, than an ordinary mechanic his trade; or a good dancer his art? than a covetous man his silver, and vainglorious man applause? 
        These to whatsoever they take an affection, can be content to want their meat and sleep, to further that every one which he affects: and shall actions tending to the common good of human society, seem more vile unto thee, or worthy of less respect and intention? `;
